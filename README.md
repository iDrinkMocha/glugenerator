# glugenerator
The Grand Light Up (GLU) instructions generator. Software by Yang Chun Wei, 44th Hwa Chong Students' Council Mid-Autumn Festival 2017 Lightings I/C. Dedicated to future batches of councillors. Feel free to commit and propose changes!

Room for improvement:
1. Add function to implement light chases
(Honestly just take interval between start and end time and divide by number of lanterns you need to light up its easy programming logic but I don't have time to implement as of now when I did this so oh wellz.)
2. Faster refresh rate
- Potentially explore feeding the instructions to compare with .wav data instead of depending on the refresh rate of the mediaplayer
